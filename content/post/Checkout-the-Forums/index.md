Took me long enough to setup forums but firstly I didnt want to have to host a full lamp stack just for forums when I host a static site and second I wasnt sure what software I wanted to use. 

I finally landed on Flarum, its lightweight and can be run via docker which I am doing, on an oracle cloud instance for free nonetheless. Flarum seems pretty cool so far, Its got plugins/extensions and an easy command line based one liner to install said extensions, it seems to have a pretty modern looking responsive design and the base colors are pretty close to this blog also so thats a plus (havent figured out how to set my own or make a theme based off this blogs color scheme, add it to the list of things to do!) and last but not least you can signup/login with Steam, Discord and Reddit!
