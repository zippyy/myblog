Using a hotspot is a convenient way to stay connected when you're on the go. However, some mobile carriers limit the amount of data you can use when using a hotspot. This can be frustrating, especially if you need to use your hotspot for work or other important tasks. Fortunately, there is a solution: using TTL-changer to bypass hotspot limits on Windows. In this blog post, we'll explore what TTL-changer is, how it works, and how you can use it to bypass hotspot limits on Windows.

What is TTL-Changer?
TTL stands for Time To Live, and it is a setting in the IP protocol that determines how long a packet can travel before it is discarded. TTL-changer is a tool that allows you to change the TTL value on your Windows computer. By increasing the TTL value, you can bypass hotspot limits and use your hotspot data without restrictions.

How Does TTL-Changer Work?
When you connect to a hotspot, your device sends packets of data to the hotspot device. The hotspot device then forwards these packets to the internet. By default, the TTL value for these packets is set to 128. This means that the packets can travel 128 hops before they are discarded. However, some mobile carriers limit the number of hops that packets can travel when using a hotspot. This is done to prevent users from using too much data.

TTL-changer works by lowering the TTL value for packets sent from your Windows computer. By lowering the TTL value, your packets will be able to travel less hops (in this case between 60 and 65 TTL) before they are discarded. This allows you to bypass hotspot limits and use your hotspot data without restrictions.

How to Use TTL-Changer to Bypass Hotspot Limits on Windows
Here's a step-by-step guide to using TTL-changer to bypass hotspot limits on Windows:

*Step 1: Download and Install TTL-Changer
The first step is to download and install TTL-changer on your Windows computer. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/AzimsTech/TTL-Changer)*

*Step 2: (optional) This step is not required but does make it easier, create a folder at the root of your C drive and call it bin or tools (whatever you want really) and put the TTL-Changer file in that folder. Now hit the windows key and type path and click the first option then click environmental variables and find path, double click that and it will pop out a window with a list of file paths, click add and add your new folder path their I.E. "C:\tools" click okay and close the windows.*

*Step 3. open an elevated command prompt (check out my post on gsudo here for easy elevation of cmd and powershell prompts directly from the terminal) and run the application, If you followed the optional "Step 2" above then you can just type ttl-changer and hit enter (I renamed the file the ttl to shorten the command) and choose the option you need. There are two choices 60 (for hotspots) and 128 (for Normal Networks).*

*Step 4. After changing the TTL value, test your connection by using your hotspot and opening a cmd prompt and typing ping 127.0.0.1, You should see the TTL at the end of each ping and should be either 60 or 128 depending on the options chosen.. If everything worked correctly, you should be able to use your hotspot data without restrictions.*

Now that you have the file in your system path you can simply switch back and forth between 60 and 128 with ease!

In conclusion, using TTL-changer is a simple and effective way to bypass hotspot limits on Windows. By increasing the TTL value, you can use your hotspot data without restrictions and stay connected while on the go. However, be aware that some mobile carriers may consider this a violation of their terms of service.
