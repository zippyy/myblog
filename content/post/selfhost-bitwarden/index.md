Bitwarden is one of the best password managers I have come accross yet, It has a great CLI, well maintained browser extentions, native desktop applications, mobile applications and a fully featured web vault, In terms of checking the boxes vaultwarden so far checks them all!

In this post we will be going over how to self host the Vaultwarden iteration of Bitwarden. The official self hosted server is heavy, requires multiple docker containers, and does not include all the features, The vaultwarden itteration is written in rust, very lightweight and has all of the paid features and most of the SaaS features with the exceiption of API at the moment but that is being worked on. 

check back for the rest of this series. with this being a static site, I do all my editing from the terminal and it takes a while to get the formatting right when working with media like screenshots and code blocks. 

So long and Thanks for all the fish!
