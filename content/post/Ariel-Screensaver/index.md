As I have mentioned before I went desktopless a few years ago and switched to a desktop replacement grade laptop with a dock. I love screensavers and lock screens so two things I have on every computer in my environment is the [City Art Search](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/9WZDNCRDTBTP?hl=en-us&gl=US&rtc=1) app from the Microsoft store and the [Ariel Screensaver](https://github.com/OrangeJedi/Aerial) from github which is a clone of the Apple TV Ariel footage screensaver and actually streams the video directly from Apple. 

A couple of honorable mentions are the [BSOD Screensaver](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/bluescreen) from Sysinternals, And the [Flux](https://github.com/sandydoo/flux) which is also a clone of another apple screensaver Drift.

As always So long and Thanks for all the fish!
