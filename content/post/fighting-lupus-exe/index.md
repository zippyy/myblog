Hello everyone. It has been a while. Shortly after my last post, life threw me a surprise side quest. I developed lupus and the next two years became a mix of system crashes, mystery errors, and unexpected restarts. In short, I was extremely sick and operating in safe mode.

I am happy to say that things look very different now. I started a new treatment about three months ago and it completely changed the game. My CPU load dropped. My energy returned. The constant background noise finally quieted down. It feels like someone pushed a major firmware update and suddenly everything runs smoother.

## What happened  
After that last post I began to experience strange symptoms. I spent months trying to make sense of them before the real culprit revealed itself. Lupus brought fatigue, pain, brain fog, and a long list of problems that made even basic tasks feel like heavy server loads. Most of my time was spent in maintenance mode with doctors, labs, medications, and rest. Writing, coding, and creating simply were not possible.

## What changed  
The last three months have been different. The new treatment is working and I feel like I have a new lease on life. My focus is sharper. My energy is returning. My motivation is back online. It is the closest thing to a hard reset I have ever experienced.

I also walked away from this with a fresh perspective. I appreciate uptime more than ever. I am more intentional about how I spend my energy. I understand the value of empathy and patience. Life is basically one big distributed system with a lot of unexpected latency, and I learned how to adapt instead of trying to brute force everything.

## What to expect  
Now that my system is stable again, the blog is coming back to life. I have a long backlog of topics I want to cover. Expect new posts about tech, cloud setups, home automation, iOS development, and a few lessons I picked up while navigating two years of health chaos.

I want to write more consistently again. I want to share what I have learned. And I want to rebuild the creative momentum that I lost while I was down.

## Thank you  
Thank you to everyone who checked in. Thank you to everyone who waited. And thank you to the people in my life who helped me through all the strange and frustrating errors along the way.

## Closing  
The blog is back online. The service is responding. If you have ever been stuck in your own endless loading screen, I see you. Eventually the system recovers. Eventually the logs make sense again. And eventually you get to hit Publish.

It feels good to be writing again. More coming soon.

**So long and thanks for all the fish**
