So I came across a blog post at [Virtually Potato](https://www.virtuallypotato.com/ "Virtually Potato") about using a Git Repo, a static site generator (in this case Hugo) and free hosting from Netlify to recreate his blog from a traditional CMS or Blogging platform and decided that I would give it a go.... Man I cant believe I didn't try this sooner! I spend a lot of time in the terminal so finding something that I could mainly write from a terminal text editor as well as keep it all managed and easily accessible from any machine I may be on at the time with a GitHub Repo was a must. 

I only recently got the itch to start a blog so I didnt have much in the way of posts or content to transfer over but even if I had a large blog with hundreds or even thousands of posts, Hugo makes it easy to convert, you can be up and running in no time flat!

Check out the link above to get started with hugo yourself and Drop a comment below with your experience with hugo!
