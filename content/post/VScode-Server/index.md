I wrote another post about how I switched from Sublime text 3 to VS Code, well I am still using it and its still awesome! 

I found a really cool docker that allows you to run the VS Code in a browser, now extentions are limited and it took some tinkering to grt it as clost to my desktop setup, its not exactly the same as some extensions are missing or not compatible but its better than nothing especially since it works in a mobile browser. 

In fact I am actuall writing this post from my phone in a nice themed editor with syntax highlighting which is huge for me. Just another reason why I am still stoked about VS Code. 

check out the docker if you use vs code and want a browser based option for on the go. 

So Long and Thanks for sll the Fish!
