Text Editors, There are so many options depening on OS, I personally have used Sublime Text across Operating Systems for well over a decade, I have written most of these posts (only exeption is when I have written a post here and there in the terminal with something like nano or vi) in Sublime Text, I even have a Github Gist to backup my settings and packages so they are the same across all my machines which is awesome! 

Sublime Text has a tonne of Extensions including a plethora of Syntax Hightlighting but seems to lack support for Hugo as a whole, theres some bits and pieces in the form of extensions but it leaves me wanting more so I decided to venture into another editor, in this case I settles on Microsoft's VS Code due to its support for extensions including many of the same ones I am using in Sublime Text as well as so many more, one of which is way better support for hugo including shortcodes!

So I am only a day or so into using VS Code and so far I have only been editing posts, pages, and making changes to config files for this site but so far I am realy enjoying it, In fact I am writing this post in VS Code. I will do a follow up post after I have had sufficient time to use it and report back my comparison of pros and cons between Sublime Text and VS Code. 

Let me know in the comments or over on the [Forums](https://forum.techrelay.xyz/) with your choice of editor + extensions!

So long and Thanks for all the Fish!
