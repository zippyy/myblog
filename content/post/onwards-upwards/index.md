It has been a little while since my last update. I am 4 months into life-changing (for me, at least) lupus treatment which has given me so much of my life back yet it still seems like I have so far left to go! 

I am now empolyed by GL.iNet and absoloutely loving working for the company inspired me to start this blog so many years ago! I was invited to the GL.iNet 15th Anniversary Conference in October and was able to meet the founders and other key people in the organizaton which thankfully lead to my current tenure! 


I have a bunch of incoming content, I have new hardare to play with and have even published my first useful script to (Github!)[https://github.com/techrelay/GL.iNet-CellularModels-SMSonBoot] *inserts shameless plug here*. I am going to do a bunch of cellular related posts as I have really been enjoying the Puli AX on my travels.  

Drop a comment below if there is something you want me to cover in a future post or series! 

**Mic Drop**

Dont forget to bring a towel!
