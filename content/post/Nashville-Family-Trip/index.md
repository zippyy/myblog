Every year my [spouse's](https://traumatotravel.xyz) family gets together for a family trip, last year they came to us in Colorado and we went to Breckenridge, this year we settled on Nashville. If you have read my other posts up till now you know that I got laid off in November of 22' and despite applying to more jobs in this period than I ever have in my career combined, yet still no employment. I have been consulting as well as the revenue I make from this site and my spouse does have a decent job however our lifestyle has drastically changed with a 3/4 reduction in household salary. 

Ultimately we thought that we would not be able to make it, airfare is exceedingly expensive these days, and we had recently had the clutch in [Porky](https://traumatotravel.xyz/) go out at a time when we did not have the funds to get it replaced however family came to rescue in the form of my parents helping us out with the cost thus restoring our hope in the ability to make it out to Nashville. We were able to stash enough away between Porky getting her clutch replaced and now so we decided to just go ahead and drive. Why not right? you only live once and like we like to say, [Adventure Called, We Answered!](https://adventurecalled.xyz)
