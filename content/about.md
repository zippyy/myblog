To start off, my two biggest passions are Travel and Technology. I have been fortunate enough to visit over 65 countries and counting, experiencing once-in-a-lifetime moments along the way. In my youth, I was fluent in five languages and technology played a huge role in helping me stay in touch with friends and family as I moved around the world. Whether it was IRC, AIM, Jabber/XMPP, MSN, or Yahoo, I made heavy use of these communication tools to keep up correspondence with those who mattered to me.

As I grew older, my interest in technology only intensified. I began building websites in high school and eventually went on to repair consumer devices before transitioning into a career in IT. Currently, I work as a Virtualization and Cloud Engineer and have been in the industry for over 16 years. I am constantly learning new things, maintaining my infrastructure, and sharing my knowledge with peers. In my free time, I enjoy learning about new technology, adding to my tech stack, and pursuing my hobbies, which include anything tech-related, snow sports, hiking, camping, fishing, and playing darts.

Travel remains a significant passion of mine and I am always seeking new adventures. Spending time with loved ones is also a priority for me, as is playing video games (particularly RPGs, action/adventure games, and shooters).
